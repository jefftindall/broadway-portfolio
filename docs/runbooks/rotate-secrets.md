# Runbook: Rotate secrets

Secrets live in Azure Key Vault as the source of truth. Managed Functions on SWA **do not resolve** `@Microsoft.KeyVault(...)` app settings — they need the resolved values in SWA configuration. Terraform apply and [scripts/sync-swa-api-secrets.sh](../../scripts/sync-swa-api-secrets.sh) copy those values from Key Vault into SWA.

`AAD_CLIENT_SECRET` is the exception: SWA’s auth platform **does** resolve Key Vault references, so that setting stays a reference.

| Environment | Key Vault | Resource group | Static Web App |
|---|---|---|---|
| Staging | `kv-elyse-staging` | `rg-elyse-portfolio-staging` | `swa-elyse-portfolio-staging` |
| Production | `kv-elyse-prod` | `rg-elyse-portfolio-prod` | `swa-elyse-portfolio-prod` |

After updating a vault secret used by the Studio API, sync into SWA (commands below, **Actions → Sync SWA API secrets → Run workflow**, or `terraform apply` for that environment). Values appear in Terraform state and SWA app settings (encrypted at rest by Azure).

## Sync SWA API secrets (no redeploy)

### Staging (copy/paste)

```bash
./scripts/sync-swa-api-secrets.sh staging
```

### Production (copy/paste)

```bash
./scripts/sync-swa-api-secrets.sh prod
```

Requires Azure CLI login with permission to read the vault and update the Static Web App.

## Rotate Gemini API key

1. Create a new key in Google AI Studio
2. Update both vaults:

```bash
az keyvault secret set --vault-name kv-elyse-staging --name GEMINI-API-KEY --value "<new>"
az keyvault secret set --vault-name kv-elyse-prod --name GEMINI-API-KEY --value "<new>"
```

3. Sync both environments (script above or Sync SWA API secrets workflow)
4. Revoke the old Gemini key
5. Publish a harmless Studio update to verify

## Rotate the GitHub App private key

1. GitHub App settings → **Private keys → Generate a private key**
2. Upload to both Key Vaults:

```bash
az keyvault secret set --vault-name kv-elyse-staging --name GITHUB-APP-PRIVATE-KEY --file ./new-key.pem
az keyvault secret set --vault-name kv-elyse-prod --name GITHUB-APP-PRIVATE-KEY --file ./new-key.pem
```

3. Sync both environments (script above or Sync SWA API secrets workflow)
4. Delete the previous private key in the GitHub App UI
5. Delete the local `.pem`
6. Verify Studio can still commit

App ID and installation ID rarely change; only update those Key Vault secrets if you recreate the App or reinstall it, then sync.

## Rotate the Entra client secret (Studio login)

The secret is created by Terraform (`azuread_application_password`) and written to Key Vault as `AAD-CLIENT-SECRET`.

Rotation is automatic: a `time_rotating` resource triggers a replacement secret every `entra_secret_rotation_days` (default 300), while each secret stays valid for `entra_secret_lifetime` (default one year). Because rotation happens before expiry, a routine `terraform apply` picks up the new secret with no outage.

To force rotation early:

```bash
cd infra/environments/<env>
terraform apply -replace='module.portfolio.azuread_application_password.swa'
```

Either path issues a new secret, updates Key Vault, and leaves the SWA app setting reference intact. Confirm sign-in at `/studio` afterward.

## GitHub Actions deploy credentials

There is **no long-lived SWA deploy token** in GitHub secrets. Actions use OIDC (`azure/login`) and fetch the SWA API key at job runtime via `az staticwebapp secrets list`.

To rotate Entra trust for Actions, re-apply Terraform (federated credentials are declarative). Resetting the SWA deployment token in the Azure Portal is optional; the next workflow run picks up the current key automatically.

## Rules

- Never put secrets in git, Terraform `tfvars`, or chat logs
- Prefer GitHub App private keys and OIDC over PATs
- Delete downloaded `.pem` files after uploading to Key Vault
- After changing API secrets in Key Vault, always sync to SWA (script, workflow, or terraform apply)
